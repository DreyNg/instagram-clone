# ℹ️ Instagram Clone Project

Deploy: [Link](https://instagram-clone-e91a2.web.app/)

This project is an attempt to recreate the functionality and design of Instagram. It's a web application built using ReactJs with tailwind for UI and Firebase for back end as a service to mimic various features of Instagram, such as posting images, following other users, liking posts, etc.

## 🆕 Features

-   **User Authentication**: Allow users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.
-   **Create Posts**: Ability to create and share posts with images and captions.
-   **User Profile**: Profiles for each user showing their posts and information.
-   **Follow/Unfollow**: Functionality to follow and unfollow other users.
-   **Like and Comment**: Allow users to like posts and add comments.
-   **Real-Time Updates**: Real-time updating of posts, likes, and comments.

## Technologies Used

-   Frontend: ReactJs | TailwindCSS
-   Backend: Firebase
-   Database: FireStore
-   Deployment: Firebase Hosting

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-clone.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd instagram-clone
    ```

    ```bash
        npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables or configurations (if any).

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2. (Important) Open your browser and navigate to http://[your-ipv4-address]:3000 to view the application.

    This is required instead of normal localhost because I am using ImgUr API to store images, and ImgUr API blocks all requests from localhosts
