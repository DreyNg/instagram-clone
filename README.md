In my last project, my man Aden McCusker made me code in Flutter 🤮. Flutter was too good I almost forgot how to use ReactJs and NextJs.

This project is an attempt to revisit ReactJs by recreating the functionality and design of Instagram. It's a web application built using ReactJs with tailwindCSS for UI and Firebase for back end as a service to mimic various features of Instagram, such as posting images, following other users, liking posts, etc.

    This is required instead of normal localhost because I am using ImgUr API to store images, and ImgUr API blocks all requests from localhosts
